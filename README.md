# Kali-Uni-Certification

University of Kali Linux is my college project that is undone, due to lack of resources and ideas, as well as dedication and time to proceed on making it more like a hack the box certification, but just a desktop system not a web page. As you can see the certificates I have used on the picture (others.png) are from HackThaBox web certification, It's just mainly a project inspired from that web page.

There is also a test authoring page for administrations, and records of students enrolled, as well as the records for those examineers and the pdf files that are used in the library page of the system. MSSQL is the database that I have used to store them, no API yet, but if someone is interested to collab, don't hesitate to contact me. THANK YOU :)..... Wawayoooooooo
